## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a unique "stateless" approach to F-Droid repositories:

1.  **Source of Truth:** `apps.yaml` defines the list of apps and their metadata.
2.  **Phase 1: Watcher:** A scheduled workflow checks GitHub for new releases of tracked apps.
3.  **Phase 2: Setup:** Prepares the directory structure and fetches/updates icons.
4.  **Phase 3: Download:** Downloads APKs from GitHub Releases and passes them as artifacts (not committed to git).
5.  **Phase 4: Index:** Uses `fdroidserver` to generate the repository index (`index-v1.jar`) with APKs from artifacts.
6.  **Phase 5: Deploy:** Publishes the static website and repository to GitHub Pages.

**Key Point:** APKs are NOT stored in the git repository. They are downloaded during the build process and used only for index generation, keeping the repository lightweight.

For detailed technical information about the architecture, see the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).
